* Question 2                                                                                                          
  You are working in an MNC, which manages the Transactions, where only BST is used as a Data Structure. The company stores all the data of transactions in BST such that   the tree is always a complete BST. 
  A new business requirement has arrived where the BST should not contain any left node.
  You are required to modify the existing BST and display the node values present in ascending order.
  Hint: ( Convert the Binary Search Tree into a Skewed Tree).

* This project has 2 packages :
  * com.glproject2.driver- this has the driver class and most of the solution code.
  * com.glproject2.node- this has the Linked list Node Class used in creating a BST

* Concepts :
   * <b>Data structures</b> - Essential components that help organize and store data efficiently in computer memory. They provide a way to manage and manipulate data effectively, enabling faster access, insertion, and deletion operations. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs , each serving specific purposes based on the requirements of the problem at hand. Understanding data structures is fundamental for designing efficient algorithms and optimizing software performance.
     
   * <b>DSA</b> - Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental part of Computer Science that teaches you how to think and solve complex problems systematically. Using the right data structure and algorithm makes your program run faster, especially when working with lots of data.
     
   * <b>Binart Search Trees</b> - A Binary Search Tree is a data structure used in computer science for organizing and storing data in a sorted hierarchical manner. Each node in a Binary Search Tree has at most two children, a left child and a right child, with the left child containing values less than the parent node and the right child containing values greater than the parent node. This hierarchical structure allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations on the data stored in the tree.

   * <b>Skwewed Binart Search Trees</b> - A skewed binary tree is a type of binary tree in which all the nodes have only either one child or no child.
